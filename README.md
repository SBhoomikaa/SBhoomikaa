ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bhoomika!
Iâ€™m a second-year Computer Engineering student at RVCE, with a strong passion for Python programming. Iâ€™m currently diving deeper into machine learning, particularly working on a handwritten answer script recognition project that combines OCR  and NLP (like BERT) for automatic evaluation of handwritten text.
Iâ€™m also passionate about cybersecurity and data structures.
